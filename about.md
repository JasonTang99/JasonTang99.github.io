# About This Site

This is my personal blog site for Computer Science related topics. Here, I will express my views and thoughts on topics I am interested in. Feel free to use anything of mine, there's no need to ask for permission.

I used the [Jekyll][jekyll] and a modified version of the [plainwhite-jekyll][plain_gh] theme.

The source code is available on [my Github][site_gh].
